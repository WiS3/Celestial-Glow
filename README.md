Provides global settings and body specific overrides:

- **Ambient Intensity**: Only affect the vessel and some objects on bodies
- **Day Intensity**: Used in *[local space](## "The game is using a higher resolution model when you are close to the body")* when you are on the *day* side of the body
- **Night Intensity**: Used in *[local space](## "The game is using a higher resolution model when you are close to the body")* when you are on the *night* side of the body
- **Scaled Intensity**: Used in *[scaled space](## "The game is using a lower resolution model when you are far away from the body")*, but does affect also local space sligtly

If you want to boost the light in the dark side of the planets where it is pitch black, just tweaking the Night Intensity does the job.

### Notes:
- Does not work in Map Mode, only Flight Mode
- Gas Giants and Water/Oceans are not affected
